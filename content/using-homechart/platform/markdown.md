# Markdown

You can use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to format text within Homechart.  Using Markdown, you can turn things into links, make text bold/italic, creating lists, and more.  [Here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) is an overview of the basic Markdown syntax.

Don't be afraid of Markdown!  It's really easy to use, and most things that use Markdown in Homechart have a **Preview** button so you can view what it looks like before you save.

## Linking Within Homechart {#linking}

Homechart can reference various things inside Homechart using Markdown.  Using the `#` symbol, you can create a link or display information about most things within Homechart.  When Homechart sees `#cookrecipe/acode`, it will replace with a link to the Recipe.
