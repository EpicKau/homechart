# Backups

Please remember to backup your data! Self hosted Homechart is easy to backup: all persistent data is stored in PostgreSQL, Homechart doesn't save anything locally. You can use tools like `pg_dump` or `wal-g` to perform the backup. Optionally, you can subscribe to Homechart Premium for automated, encrypted backups stored in an offsite location.
