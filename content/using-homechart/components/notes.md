# Notes

Notes help you organize and manage your household knowledgebase and wiki.

{{<hint info>}}
Our household uses Notes as a way to remember things, like how to use the generator in case of a blackout or important phone numbers/contacts for babysitters.

I added Notes to Homechart as a way to centralize a bunch of Google Docs.  I wanted a household wiki without having to spin up any of the various wiki solutions, and I wanted to be able to reference things without have to copy/paste links everywhere.

## Pages

You create Pages within Notes.  Pages can live within other Pages, have Tags, and use [Markdown](../markdown) for the **Body** of the page.

### Versions

Every time you edit a page, you create a new Version.  These Versions are saved within Homechart, and you can view them or restore them in case you made a mistake.  Tap the **date at the bottom** to view old Versions.

## Integrations

Notes integrates with everything, as most users use the [Markdown Linking](../markdown#linking) to organize items across Homechart, such as planning a party or vacation.
