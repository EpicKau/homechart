# Using Homechart

Homechart is a platform designed for organizing and managing your household data.  Homechart does this using **Accounts** and **Households**:

- **Accounts** are user accounts that access Homechart.
- **Households** are are groups of **Accounts** that share things in Homechart.  Accounts can be part of multiple Households.
- Everything in Homechart is owned by an **Account** or a **Household**.

Homechart has **Components** that are responsible for managing a specific type of data, like **Bookmarks**, **Budget**, **Calendar**, etc.  Components within Homechart can be:

- **Hidden**, if you're not planning on using Homechart to manage that data
- **Restricted**, if you do not want certain members of your household to manage that data

Some Components only work with Households.  See [our pricing page](https://homechart.app/pricing) for details.
