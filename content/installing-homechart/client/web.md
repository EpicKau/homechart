Homechart can be used by any web browser.  Visit https://web.homechart.app or your self-hosted URL to get started.  On compatible devices, Homechart will prompt you to install it--this will install Homechart as if it is a native app.

{{<hint info>}}
Homechart uses a lot of neat web technologies to be as close to a native app as possible.  We spend a lot of time ensuring it's fast, doesn't slow down your device, and feels responsive and snappy.
