{{<hint info>}}
The iOS version of Homechart is a repackaging of the web version using a tool called [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/).  This repackaging has caused some problems in the past, and we do occasionally run into iOS specific bugs.  If you notice something not looking/feeling right on iOS, please contact us!
