# Households

Using households in Homechart [requires a subscription](https://homechart.app/pricing/), even for self-hosted users.  You can subscribe monthly or yearly , or buy a lifetime subscription/one time purchase, too.

## Linking Your Household to Homechart Cloud

You'll need to link your self-hosted instance household to a household on Homechart Cloud to use your subscription.  No data is transferred to Homechart Cloud, it's just used to transfer the subscription details.

- Sign up for a new account on [Homechart Cloud](https://web.homechart.app)
- On Homechart Cloud, create a household and setup a subscription (either during setup or under https://web.homechart.app/subscription)
- On your self-hosted instance, go to `Subscription` in the menu and copy the `Self-Hosted ID`
- On Homechart Cloud, paste the `Self-Hosted ID` into the appropriate field.  Your household should now be linked!

You can enable these cloud features for your self-hosted instance:
