## Mike's Comments

{{<hint info>}}
Hello, I'm Mike, the creator of Homechart.  Throughout the docs, you may see blue comments like this, it's just me talking about how I use Homechart or adding more details about something.

I built Homechart to scratch a need for my household back in 2017--we had too many apps, none of them integrated, and they all had wildly different interfaces.  I wanted to build something where I didn't have to type the same event into multiple places, where I could view everything at once, and where I felt comfortable storing my data.

Homechart is a project I really enjoy working on, and I hope you and your household find it useful.  I have big plans for Homechart, and while it may not yet have all the bells and whistles of single purpose apps, I think having all of your data in one spot is huge benefit.  I appreciate any feedback you have on the app, the docs, or anything else, your feedback drives me to keep improving Homechart.
